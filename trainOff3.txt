 I’m writing to encourage you to review ODU’s winter term offerings. There are a limited number of courses offered completely online starting December 29 and end January 15. Winter Term courses are compressed online versions of courses. Instructors pack a full semester's worth of knowledge into three short weeks with the same great faculty, classes, services, and learning opportunities. Consult your academic advisor and your degree plan to assure courses count towards your degree completion

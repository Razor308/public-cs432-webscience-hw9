Important! The Student Opinion Surveys schedule is based on the session and course dates of the course.

In order to encourage participation in the Student Opinion Survey, Information Technology Services (ITS) is sponsoring a drawing for two 10.2" iPads WiFi 32GB after the end of the current semester. You will automatically be entered in the drawing once per course for each survey that you complete.

Please complete your Student Opinion Surveys to provide ANONYMOUS feedback about your instructor, course content and overall experience. Your feedback will enhance your academic experience and that of others at the university.

Complete your surveys via: Student Opinion Surveys

Thank you for your participation in the Student Opinion Surveys!

This is a reminder about the Student Opinion Survey, where you can provide feedback on this course. You need to complete this survey before December 11th. I will give 5 extra marks to students who will complete the survey. I will add these extra marks to the total grade of your weekly programming assignments. I hope this is another way to help.

I created a submission link on Blackboard where you can provide a proof of completing the survey. You will need take a picture/screenshot of the completion message and submit this screenshot to the link which I created on Blackboard.

You can access the survey from the University's Current Students page: 

    Go to http://www.odu.edu
    Click INFO FOR then Current Students
    Scroll down the page to Student Links and Resources
    Click Academics
    Click Student Opinion Survey

Thank you,

 My company, CivilianCyber, is partnering with other Virginia organizations to create the Student Training Engagement Program (STEP) to offer internships and
online training to students interested in entering the cybersecurity field. Would you be the correct person to pass along this information and opportunity to students in the Computer Science department at Old Dominion University?
 Here is a blurb about the program:
Looking for a spring internship in cybersecurity? Apply to STEP, a six-month, fully-paid internship program for students looking to gain industry experience in areas such as Law and Ethics, Data and Web Security, Cybersecurity and Cyber Defense. This program requires 10 hours/week at a local company and online training in a cybersecurity certification that has an $8,000 value. Follow this link to learn more and apply.
 Attached is a pdf containing more information on the program. Please, let me know if this is something you can do or if you need any more information. Thank you, and have a great weekend!

 Dear all,

Dr. Benedict Paten, an Associate Professor in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) and an Associate Director of the UCSC Genomics Institute will present "Computational Pangenomics" on Friday, December 4th at 2 PM.

Dr. Paten directs the Computational Genomics Lab at UCSC, which is broadly focused on computational genomics, creating algorithms, software and services addressing biomolecular challenges. He will present their group's work to build pangenomes for humans and to integrate this more comprehensive knowledge of human variation with the knowledge that we gain by comparing the genomes of related primates and vertebrates.
